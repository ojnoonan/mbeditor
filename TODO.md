# TODO — mbeditor

## CI / release workflow

- [ ] `test.yml` — add a Rails 8.x matrix entry; gemspec declares `< 9.0` but only Rails 7.1 and default (latest) are tested explicitly
- [ ] `test.yml` — add Ruby 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 matrix entries; gemspec declares `>= 3.0.0` but only Ruby 3.0 is tested
- [x] Add security scanning to CI — no Brakeman or `bundler-audit` step in `test.yml`; static analysis would catch several of the issues below automatically

## Security

- [ ] `grep --exclude-dir` fallback (`editors_controller.rb` ~line 211) — `--exclude-dir=#{dir_name}` uses string interpolation; validate `dir_name` against `/\A[\w.\/-]+\z/` for defense-in-depth (admin-configured value, but good practice)
- [ ] Git diff/blame/history ref validation (`git_controller.rb` lines 29-30) — the allowed regex includes `@`, which permits reflog syntax like `@{-1}`; exclude `@` or add an explicit blocklist for reflog patterns
- [ ] Class-level binary probe caches (`editors_controller.rb` lines 696-732) — `rubocop_available?`, `haml_lint_available?`, and `git_available?` use a `get || set` pattern on class instance variables that is not atomic; under concurrent Puma workers, multiple threads can bypass the `cache.key?(key)` guard simultaneously and spawn duplicate `--version` subprocesses; wrap with a `Mutex` or use `||=` inside `Mutex#synchronize`
- [ ] Redmine SSL verification (`redmine_service.rb` line ~59) — `Net::HTTP` HTTPS connection does not set `http.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER`; in some Ruby configurations peer certificates are not verified, exposing the API key to MITM interception
- [ ] CSRF protection relies solely on `X-Mbeditor-Client: 1` header (`editors_controller.rb` line 10) — `skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token` disables Rails CSRF entirely; a forged cross-origin request from an attacker-controlled page running in the same browser could include this header via a custom fetch; consider keeping CSRF token validation or at least verifying `Origin`/`Referer` against the host

## Configuration

- [ ] `configuration.rb` — `workspace_root` is not validated at startup; a nil/blank value crashes on first file access with an unhelpful error; raise `ArgumentError` in an `after_initialize` hook instead
- [ ] `editors_controller.rb` line 18 — `RUBOCOP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 15` is hardcoded; move to `config.lint_timeout` so users with slow systems or extensive RuboCop rule sets can adjust it
- [ ] `git_controller.rb` line ~208 — base branch candidates (`origin/develop`, `origin/main`, etc.) are hardcoded; teams with non-standard conventions get wrong results; expose as `config.base_branch_candidates`
- [ ] `git_service.rb` — git subprocess calls via `Open3.capture3` have no timeout; a hung git process (waiting for credentials, slow network remote) blocks the Puma thread indefinitely; add a configurable `config.git_timeout` and wrap `run_git` with `Timeout.timeout`

## Missing tests

- [x] `TestRunnerService` — no test file exists; at minimum cover `detect_framework`, `test_file?`, and `test_file_candidates` (pure/side-effect-free); also cover the `nil` framework fallback path (`detect_framework` falls through without returning when neither minitest nor rspec is detected)
- [x] `raw` endpoint — no test for the 413 response when a file exceeds 5 MB; the `show` endpoint has this coverage but `raw` does not (`editors_controller.rb` lines 100-109)
- [x] Search length boundary — the 500-character query cap is tested for the over-limit case but not at the boundary (499, 500, 501 chars)
- [x] Symlink edge cases in write operations — `save`, `create_file`, and `rename` use `File.expand_path` (not `realpath`) for new paths; no tests verify that a parent directory which is a symlink pointing outside the workspace is rejected
- [ ] Path traversal coverage gaps — only a few endpoints (`show`, `raw`, `diff`, `blame`) have explicit traversal tests; `save`, `create_file`, `create_dir`, `rename` (both old and new paths), `delete`, `lint`, and `format` are untested for `../../` style inputs
- [ ] `git_blame_service_test.rb` does not exist — cover porcelain output parsing, the final-block completeness guard, and behavior on a file with no trailing newline
- [ ] `git_file_history_service_test.rb` does not exist — cover `--follow` rename tracking and empty history (new file with no commits)
- [ ] `git_commit_graph_service_test.rb` does not exist — cover `isLocal` flag logic, merge commits (multiple parents), and the 150-commit cap
- [ ] No tests exercise git service behavior when the `git` binary is absent or the repo is in a broken state (detached HEAD, shallow clone, missing objects)

## Quality / robustness

- [ ] `parse_porcelain_status` (`editors_controller.rb` ~line 738) — slices lines with `[3..]` without checking length first; malformed or empty git output lines will raise `NoMethodError`; add a length guard
- [ ] `redmine_service.rb` — Redmine configuration is only validated when `call` is first invoked, not at startup; misconfiguration goes undetected until a request is made; validate in an `after_initialize` block when `redmine_enabled` is true
- [ ] `git_blame_service.rb` lines 56-82 — blame parsing relies on implicit line ordering from `git blame --porcelain`; if the file ends mid-entry (e.g. file with no trailing newline plus edge case in git version), the final `current` block may be added with missing fields; add a completeness guard before appending
- [ ] `git_controller.rb` `combined_diff` (lines 141-147) — when `scope=branch` and the branch has no upstream configured, the endpoint returns `{diff: ""}` identically to an empty diff; the frontend cannot distinguish "no changes" from "no upstream set"; return a distinct key (e.g. `no_upstream: true`) so the UI can surface a helpful message
- [ ] `editors_controller.rb` ~lines 508, 572 — tmpfile path for RuboCop/HAML fix operations is constructed manually with `SecureRandom.hex`; use `Tempfile.create` instead to avoid the unlikely but possible collision and to ensure cleanup on unexpected exits
- [ ] `editors_controller.rb` workspace state file (`tmp/mbeditor_workspace.json`) — written without file locking; concurrent requests from multiple browser tabs can produce interleaved writes and corrupt JSON; use an advisory lock (`File.flock`) around read-modify-write
- [ ] `editors_controller.rb` ~line 226 — `JSON.parse(line) rescue next` in the search results loop silently discards malformed lines with no logging; add a `Rails.logger.warn` so encoding or format regressions are observable
- [ ] `git_service.rb` — `parse_git_log` and `parse_git_log_with_parents` share nearly identical structure but are maintained separately; extract a shared private method parameterised by whether parents are included

## Frontend

- [ ] `file_service.js` and `git_service.js` both define an identical `basePath()` helper (lines 6-8 in each); if `MBEDITOR_BASE_PATH` changes the path logic must be updated in two places; extract to a shared module or inline constant
- [ ] `editor_store.js` `subscribeToSlice` — uses `===` to detect state changes; object slices are compared by reference, so in-place mutations to nested state will not trigger subscriber callbacks; document (or enforce) that all state updates must produce a new object reference
- [ ] `GitPanel.js` line ~18 — `expandedCommits` is component-local state and resets on every page load; for large repos users repeatedly expand the same commits; persist to `localStorage` keyed by repo path

## Nice to have

- [ ] Markdown preview (`EditorPanel.js` line 468) — `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with `marked.parse()` blocks raw HTML via custom renderer but does not sanitise `javascript:` scheme in links/images; low practical risk since only local files are rendered, but worth hardening with a `href` sanitiser pass
